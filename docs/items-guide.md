# Chimera Items Guide

## The Four Humors System

In the medieval world of Chimera, healing items are based on the historical theory of the **Four Humors**—the belief that the body contains four essential fluids that must remain in balance for good health.

| Humor | Quality | Association | Imbalance Causes |
|-------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Blood (Sanguine)** | Hot/Moist | Vitality, life force, courage | Weakness, fatigue, wounds |
| **Phlegm** | Cold/Moist | Mind, spirit, focus, calm | Confusion, magical exhaustion |
| **Yellow Bile (Choler)** | Hot/Dry | Energy, digestion, heat | Poison, fever, corruption |
| **Black Bile (Melancholy)** | Cold/Dry | Solidity, structure, stability | Disease, decay, death |

## Core Healing Items

### Sanguine Draught
**Effect:** Restores 50 HP
**Humor:** Blood (Hot/Moist) - Restores vitality

A warm, iron-tasting tonic brewed to stoke the inner fires and replenish the Sanguine humor. Often smells faintly of copper and old wine.

**Ingredients:** Red wine (for heat), honey (antiseptic), and iron-rich herbs like Nettle or Yarrow (historically used to stanch bleeding).

### Theriac Electuary
**Effect:** Restores 200 HP
**Humor:** Black Bile (Cold/Dry) - Purges decay, the Ultimate Cure

A thick, bitter sludge renowned as the "Great Cure." It violently purges the body of excess Melancholy (Black Bile) and swiftly knits flesh back together.

**Ingredients:** A complex electuary of snake flesh, opium, myrrh, and dozens of rare herbs. Historical Theriac (Venice Treacle) contained up to 64 ingredients.

### Hartshorn Salts
**Effect:** Revives a fallen ally with 1 HP
**Humor:** Pneuma (Spirit) - Recalls the vital spirits

A pouch of crushed deer antler and vinegar. The piercing, acrid scent is potent enough to shock the soul back into the body, rousing the unconscious from their stupor.

**Medieval Logic:** Fainting or "swooning" was believed to occur when vital spirits retreated to the heart. Strong pungent odors were used to shock the system and recall these spirits. Hartshorn (ammonium carbonate from deer antler) was the precursor to modern smelling salts.

### Mithridate
**Effect:** Cures Poison
**Humor:** Yellow Bile (Hot/Dry) - Expels toxins

A chewable leaf of bitter Rue coated in Mithridate paste. It expels toxic Yellow Bile (Choler) from the stomach.

**History:** Mithridate was a semi-mythical antidote supposedly used by King Mithridates VI to build immunity to poisons. Rue (herb of grace) was a common folk remedy believed to repel toxins.

### Aqua Vitae
**Effect:** Restores 30 MP
**Humor:** Phlegm (Cold/Moist) - Refines into Spirit

Highly distilled spirits of wine. It burns the throat but clarifies the mind, sharpening the Pneuma (spirit) required to weave reality.

**Etymology:** "Aqua Vitae" means "Water of Life." Medieval alchemists believed distilled alcohol preserved youth and invigorated the spirit.

## Simple Provisions

These common items provide basic sustenance:

| Item | Effect | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Stale Bread | Restore 25 HP | Hard but filling. A traveler's staple. |
| Dried Meat | Restore 75 HP | Salted and preserved for long journeys. |
| Herb Bundle | Cure Poison | Freshly picked medicinal herbs. A simpler alternative to Mithridate. |
| Spring Water | Restore 15 MP | Pure water from a mountain spring. |
| Traveler's Stew | Restore 50 HP, 15 MP | Hearty meal in a sealed clay pot. |
| Warding Incense | Cure all status | Fragrant smoke that cleanses afflictions. |

## The System's Secret (SPOILER - Act II+)

> **Warning:** This section contains late-game revelations. Do not reference in Act I content.

The System disguises its advanced technology as medieval medicine. What appears to be folk remedies are actually sophisticated delivery mechanisms:

| Medieval Item | True Nature |
|---------------|-------------|
| Hartshorn Salts | Pressurized adrenaline gas released from nanite capsules |
| Theriac Electuary | Dense suspension of tissue-repair nanites (the "64 ingredients" are code strings) |
| Sanguine Draught | Synthetic coagulant and hemoglobin accelerator disguised as red wine |
| Aqua Vitae | Neural stimulant that restores the subject's ability to interface with reality constructs |
| Mithridate | Targeted molecular scrubbers that neutralize chemical threats |

The System maintains this facade because direct technological intervention would cause "Glitch" events in subjects who believe in the medieval reality. The placebo effect of "medieval medicine" activates the healing nanites more efficiently.

## Herbalist Elara

Kai's sister Elara was renowned throughout Havenwood for her medicinal knowledge. Before her disappearance, she maintained an extensive collection of remedies.

Many of the healing items Kai finds during his journey may have come from Elara's own stores—giving these simple curatives a deeper emotional significance.

**Story Note:** Elara's exceptional skill with "herbal medicine" may hint at her unique relationship with the System. Was she consciously or unconsciously manipulating the nanite infrastructure?

## Item Naming Guidelines

When creating new items for Chimera:

**DO:**
- Use medieval/apothecary terminology
- Reference the Four Humors when appropriate
- Keep descriptions grounded in folk medicine understanding
- Use Latin or archaic English for sophisticated items

**DON'T:**
- Use modern medical terms (antibiotics, vitamins, supplements)
- Reference obvious technology (injections, pills, capsules)
- Use game-specific terms like "HP" or "MP" in descriptions
- Break the medieval immersion in Act I

**Examples:**
- Good: "A bitter root that steadies the nerves and calms the Choleric temperament."
- Bad: "Restores 50 HP and cures anxiety status effect."
