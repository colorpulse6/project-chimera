# Execution Scene — Scene Direction for Claude Code

## Your Role
You are the creative director for **Chimera**, an FF6-style JRPG. I need you to write the exact creative content for the game's **execution scene** — the interactive cinematic bridging the SystemBootScreen and Havenwood village exploration.

## What the Player Has Already Seen
1. **Title Screen** — "CHIMERA"
2. **Intro Cinematic** — Surrealist video: melting clockwork, code devolving into ancient scripture
3. **SystemBootScreen** — Terminal diagnostic text from the System's perspective:
   - "CYCLE 49,200... REALITY LAYER: STABLE... MEDIEVAL FACADE: RENDERED"
   - "ALERT: Unregistered Variable Detected... Identity: KAI"
   - "He comes from nowhere. He is no one. He is the Glitch."
   - "Prepare the Execution Platform."
   - Countdown: 3... 2... 1... → screen whites out

The execution scene **opens from this white-out** — white fades to reveal the top of the scene, then the camera pans down.

## What This Scene Must Do
1. **Establish dread and helplessness** — Kai has no control. The System has absolute power.
2. **Plant fragmented memories** — Elara, the "crime," the wrongness of reality
3. **Create the Disruption** — Reality fractures at the moment of the killing blow
4. **Transition to Havenwood** — White-out → blackness → gentle awakening text

The player has NO gameplay control. This is visual + textual only. Skippable.

## Technical Constraints
- **Single static background image** (portrait orientation, generated by GPT) showing the execution platform from above
- Camera starts at the **top of the image** (sky/architecture) and **slowly pans down** to reveal the platform
- **Thought bubbles** are text overlays that fade in/out at screen positions
- **System voice** types character-by-character in monospace cyan
- **Disruption** is CSS glitch effects (color shifts, screen shake, chromatic aberration, block displacement)
- **Total duration: 35-45 seconds**

## What I Need

### 1. Thought Bubble Content (4-6 bubbles)
For each:
```
THOUGHT [N]:
Text: "[exact text]" (or describe the visual flash)
Type: text | image_flash | system
Position: left | center | right
Duration: Xs
Glitch: true | false
Purpose: [what this conveys]
```

- "text" = Kai's internal words
- "image_flash" = a brief visual memory (describe what it depicts for the reader — rendered as a blurred rectangle with color)
- "system" = cold digital text (cyan, monospace)
- Keep text SHORT (2-10 words). Fragments, not sentences.

### 2. System Voice Announcement
The cold, synthesized announcement before execution:
- Exact text (1-3 sentences, clinical)
- Note any pauses with `[PAUSE Xs]`
- This is protocol, not drama. A maintenance task.

### 3. Beat Sheet (Second-by-Second)
```
0.0s - 1.5s: [description]
1.5s - 8.0s: [description]
...
```
Include: visual focus, emotional beat, when thoughts/announcements fire.

### 4. The Disruption
Describe in visual terms I can translate to CSS:
- What triggers it? (the blow about to land?)
- What does the player SEE? (colors, tearing, geometry, text?)
- Any glitch text/error messages that flash during it?
- How long before the final white-out?

### 5. Awakening Text
1-3 short lines over black, fading in one at a time:
- Internal thoughts, not spoken
- Should contrast sharply with the execution's intensity
- The last line should feel like surfacing from deep water

### 6. GPT Art Prompt (Background Image)
Write a complete prompt for GPT-4o image generation:
- Portrait orientation (1024x1536)
- Describe composition top to bottom (sky → architecture → platform)
- Specify the medieval-meets-alien-tech aesthetic
- Key elements: Kai (red spiky hair, bound, kneeling), executioners (robed, faceless), energy weapon, geometric floor markings
- Color palette, lighting, atmosphere
- What to AVOID: overt sci-fi, modern technology, anything too clearly "digital"

## Reference Material

**Kai**: Red spiky hair, navy armor, blue cape, amber eyes. Here he's a prisoner — no sword, bound, terrified. Anomaly KAI_7.34.

**The System's voice**: Cold, clinical. Devoid of emotion. "Subject KAI_7.34" — not a person, a variable.

**Tone**: NOT heroic. Kai is helpless. The escape is a chaotic system error, not his doing. No triumph — only confusion and terror. This is the existential thesis of the game: Kai is freed from one uncaring process by another chaotic force.

**Elara**: Kai's missing sister. A kind face, warm smile. The emotional anchor in this nightmare.

**The "crime"**: Something incomprehensible — the player shouldn't understand it. Just a flash of wrongness.
