# GPT Prompt: Character Walk Cycle Sprite Sheet

## Template (attach reference image of existing character)

Using this character as reference, create a **sprite sheet** with a **5 column x 3 row grid** showing a walk cycle in 3 directions.

**Character:** [NAME] — [DESCRIPTION]

**Layout:**
- **Row 1 (top):** Character facing toward the camera (front view) — 5 frames: standing idle, left foot stepping forward, both feet centered mid-stride, right foot stepping forward, return to center
- **Row 2 (middle):** Character facing left (side profile) — same 5-frame walk cycle
- **Row 3 (bottom):** Character facing away from the camera (back view) — same 5-frame walk cycle

**Requirements:**
- Match the character's exact design from the reference image
- Maintain consistent chibi proportions (large head, small body) and soft cel-shaded rendering across all 15 frames
- Each frame must be the **same size** and evenly spaced in a perfect grid with no gaps or overlap
- Plain white background behind all frames
- Subtle animation differences between frames — slight arm swing, alternating leg positions, gentle cape/clothing movement
- High resolution, clean edges, consistent proportions across every frame

## Variables to Replace
- [NAME]: Character name (e.g., "Kai", "Lyra", "Guard Captain Bren")
- [DESCRIPTION]: Physical details — hair, clothing, equipment, colors

## After Generation
1. Save to: `games/chimera/drafts/sprites/characters/[name]_walk.png`
2. Run: `/import-sprite [path] --type character --name [name]`

## Notes
- Right-facing frames are generated by flipping the left-facing row in the engine — no need to generate a separate right row
- If the AI produces 4 or 6 columns instead of 5, the engine config can be adjusted
- Avoid terms like "Final Fantasy" or other IP names in the prompt
