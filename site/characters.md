# Characters

## Kai — The Anomaly

**Class:** Anomaly | **Weapon:** Sword

A determined young man on a mission to find his missing sister, Elara. Kai speaks in short, direct sentences and never accepts surface explanations. He has an unsettling ability to notice things others can't — moments where reality seems to stutter, walls that look wrong, sounds that echo from nowhere.

**Personality:** Direct, questioning, relentless. Kai doesn't do small talk. When something doesn't add up, he digs until he finds the truth.

**Abilities:**
- **Slash** — Standard sword attack
- **Temporal Edge** — A strike that seems to bend space (8 MP)
- **Focus** — Concentrate to boost attack power

## Lady Lyra Lumina — The Diplomat

**Class:** Diplomat | **Weapon:** Staff

The youngest daughter of the Lumina noble family, Lyra has spent her life in the sheltered comfort of the estate. But comfort breeds curiosity, and Lyra craves authentic experience beyond the walls.

She speaks in formal noble dialect — "shall we" and "how wonderful" — but there's genuine warmth behind the words. She's the first to offer help, the last to give up hope.

**Personality:** Optimistic, genuinely kind, fiercely curious. Lyra sees the best in people and has a knack for diplomacy.

**Abilities:**
- **Staff Strike** — Physical attack
- **Cure** — Restore HP (6 MP)
