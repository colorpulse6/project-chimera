## What We're Looking For

Right now, we'd especially love feedback on:

- **Combat feel** &mdash; Is the ATB pacing good? Do battles feel fair?
- **Exploration** &mdash; Is the world interesting to move through?
- **Story hooks** &mdash; Does the narrative pull you in? Are you curious about what happens next?
- **Difficulty** &mdash; Too easy? Too hard? Just right?

Every piece of feedback helps. Thank you for being part of this.
