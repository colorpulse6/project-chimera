# Give Feedback

Project Chimera is being built in the open, and your feedback shapes the game. Here's how to contribute:

## GitHub Discussions (Preferred)

The best place for structured feedback. Each category helps us organize and act on your input:

- **Playtest Feedback** — General impressions after playing
- **Bug Reports** — Something broke or behaves unexpectedly
- **Balancing & Mechanics** — Damage feels off? Encounters too easy/hard?
- **Story & Lore** — Thoughts on the narrative, dialogue, world-building
- **UI/UX** — Interface improvements, control suggestions

Found a bug? File it as a GitHub Issue with:
1. What you expected to happen
2. What actually happened
3. Steps to reproduce

## What We're Looking For

Right now, we'd especially love feedback on:

- **Combat feel** — Is the ATB pacing good? Do battles feel fair?
- **Exploration** — Is the world interesting to move through?
- **Story hooks** — Does the narrative pull you in? Are you curious about what happens next?
- **Difficulty** — Too easy? Too hard? Just right?

Every piece of feedback helps. Thank you for being part of this.
