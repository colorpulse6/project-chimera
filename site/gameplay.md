# Gameplay

Project Chimera is a classic JRPG built for the browser, inspired by the golden age of 16-bit RPGs.

## Active Time Battle (ATB)

Combat uses an ATB system inspired by Final Fantasy VI. Each character has a time gauge that fills based on their speed stat. When full, they can act — attack, use abilities, use items, or defend.

- **Speed matters** — faster characters act more often
- **Status effects** — Haste speeds you up, Slow holds you back
- **Boss phases** — Boss behavior changes as their HP drops
- **Damage variance** — FF6-style 87.5% to 112.5% randomness keeps fights interesting

## World Exploration

Explore a tile-based world with towns, dungeons, and hidden areas. Talk to NPCs, investigate objects, and uncover the story at your own pace.

- **Interact with everything** — NPCs have dialogue that changes based on your progress
- **Random encounters** — Battles happen while exploring dangerous areas
- **Map connections** — Seamless transitions between areas
- **Environmental storytelling** — The world tells stories if you look closely

## Quest System

Accept quests from NPCs, track objectives, and earn rewards. Quests range from helping villagers to confronting dungeon bosses.

- **Main quests** — Drive the story forward
- **Side quests** — Optional adventures with unique rewards
- **Story flags** — Your choices affect what happens next

## Items & Equipment

Items follow medieval apothecary traditions — no health potions here, but you'll find Sanguine Draughts, Theriac Electuaries, and Hartshorn Salts. Equipment ranges from Iron Swords to mysterious artifacts with hidden requirements.

## What's Coming

- Sound effects and music
- Save/Load system
- Party management with multiple characters
- Expanded story content through Act I and beyond
