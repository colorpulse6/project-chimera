# Gameplay

Project Chimera is a classic JRPG built for the browser, inspired by the golden age of 16-bit RPGs.

## Active Time Battle

Combat uses an ATB system inspired by Final Fantasy VI. Each character has a time gauge that fills based on their speed stat. When the gauge is full, they can act.

<div class="features">
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Speed Matters</h3>
    <p>Faster characters act more often. The ATB formula: <code>fillRate = ((speed + 20) / 16) * BASE_RATE</code></p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Boss Phases</h3>
    <p>Boss behavior changes as their HP drops. New abilities, different targeting, escalating danger.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Enemy AI</h3>
    <p>Enemies use different strategies: aggressive, defensive, smart targeting, and randomized actions.</p>
  </div>
