# What is Project Chimera?

Project Chimera is an indie JRPG built for the browser, inspired by classics like Final Fantasy VI. It's a game about a medieval world that isn't quite what it seems &mdash; where reality has seams, and something watches from behind the curtain.

## Where We Are

The core game systems are built and playable:

- **ATB combat** with enemy AI, boss phases, and ability systems
- **Tile-based exploration** with NPC dialogue, shops, and quests
- **A complete dungeon** &mdash; the Bandit Camp with prisoner rescue mechanics and a boss fight
- **Item and equipment systems** using medieval apothecary lore
- **A quest system** with tracked objectives and story-gating

You can play the current build right now from the [Play Demo]({{ site.baseurl }}/play/) page.

## What's Next

Our current focus is completing Act I of the story:

- **Lyra recruitment** &mdash; The second party member joins in Havenwood
- **Save/Load system** &mdash; Persist your progress
- **The first Glitch** &mdash; The moment reality cracks for the first time
- **Sound and music** &mdash; Bringing the world to life
