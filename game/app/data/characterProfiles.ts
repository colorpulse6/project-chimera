    quote: "These cracks in reality... they're not flaws. They're windows.",
    backstory: `Kai arrived in Havenwood with nothing but fragmented memories and a burning need to find his missing sister, Elara. The villagers know him as a capable young swordsman, quick to help but slow to trust.

What Kai himself struggles to understand are his abilities—moments when reality seems to flicker around him, when he glimpses patterns and "seams" that others cannot see. These visions come unbidden, like static interference in an otherwise clear picture.

His search for Elara has led him to the Whispering Ruins, where ancient secrets stir. What he discovers there may shatter everything he believes about himself and the world around him.`,

  lyra: {
    id: "lyra",
    title: "Lady of the Lumina",
    quote: "Fortune favors those who refuse to surrender to fate.",
    backstory: `Lady Lyra Lumina descends from one of the great houses—keepers of ancient knowledge passed down through generations. Yet she has always felt out of place among the nobility, more drawn to dusty archives than courtly intrigue.

Her "unusual luck" is whispered about in noble circles. Dice fall her way. Accidents miss her by inches. Some call it blessing; others, suspicion. Lyra herself wonders if luck is truly random, or if something watches over her.

When she encountered Kai near the Whispering Ruins, she sensed something familiar—a kindred spirit touched by forces beyond the ordinary. Against her family's wishes, she chose to join his quest, seeking answers to questions she's carried all her life.`,
