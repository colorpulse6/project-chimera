    longDescription: `
Mira, the village herbalist, has run low on the rare Moonpetal Flowers
needed for her healing salves. These delicate blooms only grow in the
shadowed groves around Havenwood, and lately the forest has become
dangerous—with strange "shimmering patches" appearing among the trees.

She asks you to gather three Moonpetal Flowers and return them safely.

    // Lore blending - medieval surface, sci-fi truth
    medievalLore: `
Moonpetal Flowers are said to bloom where moonlight touches the earth
undisturbed by human presence. The wise folk say they carry the essence
of the night sky—cooling fevers and soothing troubled dreams. Herbalists
have used them for generations, though the flowers grow rarer each year.
    `.trim(),

    hiddenTruth: `
The "Moonpetal Flower" is actually a bioluminescent organism created by
The System to serve as a natural delivery mechanism for healing nanites.
The "glitches" Mira mentions are reality seams where the simulation's
rendering struggles to maintain coherence—possibly due to Kai's presence
as an anomaly disrupting local processes. By gathering the flowers, Kai
is inadvertently helping the System maintain population health metrics.

    medievalLore: `
The roads around Havenwood have always been relatively safe, protected by
the local militia and the watchful eye of the village elders. But lately,
dark rumors have spread of bandits grown bold—well-armed and fearless,
as though something has emboldened them beyond mere greed.
    `.trim(),

    hiddenTruth: `
The "bandits" are actually a rogue faction of System maintenance units that
have developed aberrant behavioral patterns. Their "lightning weapons" are
repurposed diagnostic tools. The System is aware of this malfunction but
has not yet allocated resources to correct it—suggesting either resource
constraints or deliberate observation of the anomaly's interaction with Kai.

The evidence is clear—a well-organized bandit camp lies to the east of the
Havenwood Outskirts. They've been raiding caravans, kidnapping villagers,
and stockpiling stolen goods. Elder Morris has authorized a strike against
their base.

Enter the camp, free any prisoners you find, and confront their leader. Be
warned: their chief, a scarred veteran named Vorn, wields a weapon unlike
anything the guards have ever seen.

    medievalLore: `
Bandit Chief Vorn was once a respected mercenary captain before turning to
raiding. His gang has terrorized the roads for months, but their boldness
suggests they fear no reprisal. What gave them such confidence? And what
dark purpose lies behind their kidnappings?
    `.trim(),

    hiddenTruth: `
Vorn discovered the hidden technology cache during a raid and has been
experimenting with it. The "Lightning Rod" weapon he wields is a corrupted
System diagnostic tool. The cellar contains the remains of a buried
maintenance facility—one of many scattered across the simulated world,
hidden from the inhabitants. Kai's discovery here will begin to awaken
questions about the nature of reality.

The artifact from the bandit cellar defies explanation—metal that moves on
its own, lights that glow without flame, and an energy that feels almost
alive. Elder Morris is deeply troubled and suggests finding a scholar who
might understand such things.

Ask around town about anyone with knowledge of ancient secrets. The Lumina
family is known for their extensive archives...

    medievalLore: `
The Lumina family has served as keepers of knowledge for generations. Their
estate holds one of the largest private libraries in the region, containing
texts that predate the founding of Havenwood itself. Few commoners have ever
gained entry to their archives.
    `.trim(),

    hiddenTruth: `
The Lumina family carries a genetic marker—the "Prime Code Lineage"—that
gives them elevated access privileges within the System. Their "archives"
contain fragmentary data from before the current simulation iteration.
Lady Lyra's "unusual luck" is actually subtle System protection protocols
activated by her lineage marker. Lyra finding Kai at the village gates may
not have been coincidence—her lineage code could have drawn her to the
anomaly, a System-engineered encounter to study the interaction between a
Prime Code holder and an unregistered anomaly.

    medievalLore: `
Lady Lyra has always felt different from her noble peers—more drawn to
dusty archives than courtly intrigue. The texts speak of "builders" and
"architects" who shaped the world in an age before recorded history. Could
the ruins hold answers to questions she's carried all her life?
    `.trim(),

    hiddenTruth: `
Lyra's genetic marker is resonating with the terminal systems, triggering
dormant protocols. Her presence near the anomaly (Kai) may be no coincidence
—the System may have engineered their meeting to study the interaction
between a Prime Code holder and an unregistered anomaly. Whether this is
observation or manipulation remains unclear.
